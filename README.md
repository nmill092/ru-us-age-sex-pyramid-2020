The enormous toll of World War II, followed decades later by mass economic turmoil and emigration in the wake of the fall of the USSR, have left an indelible mark on Russia's demographic structure. This simple viz attempts to compare the United States' fairly "normal" population pyramid with that of Russia, which was described in a recent [Harvard Davis Center article](https://daviscenter.fas.harvard.edu/insights/russias-discouraging-demographics-shouldnt-change-us-approach) as resembling "an unstable Christmas tree."
